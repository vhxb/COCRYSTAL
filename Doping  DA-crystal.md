## Content
### 1. Introduction
Materails: 
> - 21 CT cocrystals(3 acceptors and 7 donors).
> - Some three-component organic alloys (o-TCP-AN(x) -TP (1−x), o-TCP-Cor (x) -Pe(1−x) , and p-TCP-Cor (x) -Pe(1−x)).

### 2. Results and Discussiond
#### 2.1. Construction and Characterization of Tunable LuminescentCocrystals Materials
- 3 acceptors,7 donors and their HOMO&LUMO enengy(Figure 1).
- Changing  emission color:**species of Donor&Acceptor; Doping**.
> "Undeniably, the diﬀerence in elec-tron properties for the donor and acceptor molecules impacts theCT degree of the cocrystals, ultimately resulting in the diﬀerencein FL emission colors. Thus, the FL emission color from blueto red can be tuned by reasonable design and selecting suitabledonor-acceptor molecules in the cocrystals. In addition, a groupof binary cocrystals doping with another binary cocrystal is analternative method to obtaining multi-color emissive crystallinematerials.[35,42-44]"

#### 2.2. Construction and Characterization of Continuous EmissionAlloy Materials
**How to choose the doping molecular:**
> "Due to the similar molecular structures and molecular sizes(Cor (11.79 Å) Pe (11.52 Å)) (Figure S17a,b, Supporting Informa-tion), organic CT alloys have been obtained, in which the Cor andPe molecules can substitute with each other and rendering thepossibility for the construction of organic CT alloys. When two cocrystal components are assembled into an organic CT alloy, the 𝜋–𝜋 interaction and van der Waals forces between molecules areconsidered non-covalent interaction forces.[52]"
> 
> "Cocrys-tals with weakly combining capacity but high energy emissionscan be used as donors (Such as o-TCP-TP). The ones with morevital combining capacity and low energy emission can be consid-ered acceptors (Such as p-TCP-Pe)"

Doping advantages:
- Stepless color-Changing
- Adjust the ﬂuorescence quantum yield 
- ﬂuorescence lifetime

**How to choose the solvent**

Some explainment and analysis about result.

### 3. Conclusion
o-TCP-Cor (x) -Pe(1−x) doping cocrystal achieve stepless color-changing emission with the CIE fromblue (CIE [0.22, 0.44]) to green (CIE [0.16, 0.14]

### Material
Donor(tetratertbutylperylene (TBPe)) and acceptor(m-TCP,p-TCP,o-TCP).
> Fig 1(PL spectra)

### Conclusion
> By simply changing **the relative position of the cyan group** on the electron acceptor molecule, the optical properties of the cocrystal can be modulated without changing the unit cell parameters and crystal morphology.
>
> **The crystal morphology can be tuned** into rod-like or branched by controlling the crystal growth rate. The rod-like cocrystals show superior waveguide performance with low optical loss coefficients and the branched cocrystals exhibit multi-directional waveguide performance.

### Material
- pyrene–octafluoronaphthalene (pyrene–OFN) and doping.
- pyrene–1,2,4,5-tetracyanobezene (pyrene–TCNB) and doping.

### The problem about DA-cocrystal
The D/A pairs is limited.
> Although a variety of CT cocrystals have been constructed,they are nonetheless limited to specified complexes, whichmakes it difficult to achieve the expected functions because ofthe limited selection of electron D/A pairs.

### pyrene-OFN and pyrene-TCNB
- The difference(PL spectra) between donor/acceptor and cocrystal.
- The difference(Absorption spectra) between donor/acceptor and cocrystal.
  > pytene-OFN:not obvious change.

- pyrene–TCNB in doped pyrene–OFN
- Conclusion:
  > **As TCNB ratio gradually rise, the PL&Absorption spectra change gradually.**
  > **A energy-transfer mechanism about the doping cocrystal.**

- The structural information and properties
- The PL spectra(for BDBT)
  - BDBT-OFN: 14nm(blue shift)
    > "The blue-shifted emission is attributable to the insertion of OFN molecules to shield the p interaction between two adjacent BDBT molecules, which significantly reduces the PL redshift caused by exciton delocalization."
  - BDTB-TCNB: 157nm(red shift);85nm(the full width at half maximum)
